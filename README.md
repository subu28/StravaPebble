# StravaPebble - Suspended from Google Play due to policy violation

Google finds that the name is infringing on Strava's brand. Which is fair I guess.

Am not planning an update or anything for the time being. There were a few dozens
of people using the app. I think they will not be affected unless they need to
download the app again.

An android app to bring back the strava integration to your pebble wateches

## Project Status - Abandoned by the creator, looking for Maintainers
Sorry for abandoning the project. I had to abandon this after my pebble 2 HR died.
I know there are more than a couple people who use the app and have written to me
about a couple things I should have fixed. I would love if a android dev who happens
to use a pebble device at this time is willing to work on this small app.

## Thanks
